# RustStuff
### Repo that holds any and all rust based things I find interesting or want to work on.


Rust's documentation : [RustWebsite](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

Rust by Example : [Here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)

I will be using the rust website along with the Rust Book Second Edition.

In the future I plan to use RUST FOR RUSTACEANS as well, (Another Rust book)
