# Data Types Notepad

## Notes

- Different Type annotations so Far:
- Scalar Types, Integer Types 
- isize and usize are determined by the architecture of the computer for me that would be 64
- Overflow notes could be helpful - page 38
- Floating point can be defined as f32 and f64 (Default initialization of a floating poitn is 64 bit)

## Scalar

- Single value
- 4 Scalar Types: integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans and Characters
- 

## Integer Types

- if integer starts with i it is signed
- ![Integer Types In Rust](img/intTypes.png)
- ![Integer Literals In Rust](img/integerLiterals.PNG)


## Boolean Type

- Booleans are one byte in size, specified in rust as bool (let t = true or explicitly typed as let f: bool = true;) 

## Character Type

- Specified with '', four bytes in size
